# rne.es-program-guide-XMLTV-generator
Small Python program I've made to learn web scrapping. It takes program schedules from Spanish national radio site (http://www.rtve.es/radio/programas/radio/) and export it to a XMLTV file. Check description and specification on http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page

I've used several libraries that helped a lot:
Beautiful Soup. http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
Requests: HTTP for Humans. http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/
lxml - XML and HTML with Python. http://lxml.de/

I discovered a really nice pdb frontend in http://winpdb.org/docs/
