# rne.es-program-guide-XMLTV-generator
Small Python program I've made to learn web scrapping. It takes program schedules from Spanish national radio site (http://www.rtve.es/radio/programas/radio/) and export it to a XMLTV file. Check description and specification on http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page

I've used several libraries that helped a lot:

http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/
http://lxml.de/

I discovered a really nice pdb frontend in http://winpdb.org/docs/
